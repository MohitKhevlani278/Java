Q-1
How to create a thread by subclassing the Thread class
Class threax extends Thread and override run method
an infinite loop that inside method cause the thread repetitively sleep for after 2000
milliseconds and display "hello world".
It is neccessary to catch the interruptedException that can be thrown by sleep() method

main() method threadDemo1 instaniates a Threadx object and calls start() method 
start() method invoke run method


Q-2
How to create a thread by implements runnable interface
Class runnableY implements this interface
Write logic in run() method
Main method ThreadDemo2 instaniates a runnabley object then instaniates Thread object
Reference to the runnableY object is passed as argument to thread constructor
start() method invoke to start the thread


Q-3
How programs can wait for a threads to complete
ThreadM class extends thread and display string every second for 10 iterations.
ThreadN class extends thread and display string every two seconds for 20 iterations.
main method ThreadDemo3 create and start this two threads and display message 
after they both complete.



Q-4
- Several bank customer who make deposit to a shared bank account
- The account class encapsulates the current balance in the account
- This value is increased by synchronized method so it is no corruped
- The getBalance() method return current value of the account
- Customer class extends thread 
- Its constructor saves a reference to the shared account
- the run() method executes the loop that makes 100000 deposit. each deposit equals $10
- The bankDemo class first create one account object then 10 customer objects instantiated and started
- Join() method called to wait for each of these threads to complete
- finally balance the account is displayed




Q-5
- Remove the synchronized method from remove question

Q-6 
- create synchronized block inseted of method


Q-7
- How deadlock error occur
- Class A has two synchronized method named a1() and a2() method
- Also has an instance variable b that holds a reference to an object of class b
- a1() method call the b2() method of that object
- Similarly class B reverse of class A
- Class Thread1 extends Thread and executes a loop that invoke the a1() method of an A object
- Class Thread2 extends Thread and executes a loop that invoke the b1() method of an B object
- DeadlockDemo class create instance of the A and B classes
- It then instantiates the Thread1 and Thread2 classes and start these threads
- join() method used to wait for these threads to complete 
- final message is displayed


Q-8
- The one thread produces a sequence of integers 
- These are written to a sequence
- Several Consumer threads read the numbers from the queue and display them








Exercies :-
Q-1
- Write Application that executes 2 threads
- Thread a display every 1000 milliseconds and Thread b display every 3000 milliseconds
- Create thread by extending thread class

Q-2
- Same Condition of above question but this time use runnable interface

Q-3
- Write Application that create and start five threads
- Each thread instantiated from the same class 
- It executes a loop with 10 iterations
- Each iterations display the characters x and y sleep between 300 and 800 milliseconds
- Application wait for all thread after complete thread execution display the msessage(Done) 

Q-4
- Remove synchronized modifier from the deposit() and preceding example 
- Question use 7 number 

Q-5
- synchronized statement block instead of its method 
- Question use 7 number 

Q-6
- Example check deadlock error occur
