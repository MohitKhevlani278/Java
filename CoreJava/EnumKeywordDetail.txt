 5)Enum :-
  - Enums restrict a variable to have one of only a few predefined values
  - The values in this enumerated list are called enums
  - With the use of enums it is possible to reduce the number of bugs in your code
  Method :-
    - values() method return all enum value
    - ordinal() method use enum constant index
    - valueOf() check if exist

#7)Keyword :-
- Keyword are reserved word that cannot be used as variable,method,classes or any other identifier.
    
Keyword      Short Description
    abstract     - non-access modifier used for classes and methods(Note be used to create objects  
                   must be inherited for access , used only in abstract class /does not have body)
    assert       - for debugging
    boolean      - true or false
    catch        - catch exception generated by try
    char         - datatype
    class        - define a class
    const        - use final instead of const(means fixed value)
    enum         - unchangeable type
    exports      - exports a package with a module
    extends      - extends a class(inheritance)
    final        - non-access modifier used for classes and methods which make them non-changeable(impossible to inherit oroverride)
    finally      - in execption ,executed no matter excption arrise or not
    import       - used in package import
    implements   - implements an interface
    instanceof   - check object is instace or not
    interface    - special type of class contains only abstract methods
    native       - specifies method is not implement same java source file(but in another language)
    new          - create new object
    package      - declare a package
    private      - only accssible within the class
    protected    - accessible same package and subclasses
    public       - accessible by any other class
    require      - specifies required libraries inside a module
    return       - finishes execution of a method,return value from a method
    static       - static method can be accessiblewothout create object
    super        - refer superclass
    synchronized - non-access modifier specifies that method can only be accessible by one thread at a time
    this         - refer current object in a method or constructor
    throw        - create a custome error
    throws       - indicate what exception may be thrown by the method
    transient    - non-access modifier ,specifies that an attribute is not part of an object's persistent state
    try          - handle exception
    var          - declare a variable
    void         - method not have a return value
    volatile     - indicate an attribute is not cached threa-locally and is always read from the "main-memory"
    
    Condtion  :- if , else , break , continue , else if , switch , case ,default , for , while , do 
    Note :- true,flase,null not keywords but they are literals and reserved word
