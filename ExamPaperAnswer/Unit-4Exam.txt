Q- 4 : A 1Marks

1)________invented Hibernate framework
- Gavin King  

2)ORM Stands for :-
- Object Realtional Mapping

3)EJB Stands for :-
- Enterprise JavaBeans


Q- 4 : B 3Marks

1)Explain Session in EJB :-
 - A session can be defined as an object associated each user with a unique session ID
 - Different forms of data can be set in a session; These data related to each user of the site help the user and the website owner 
   in different ways. 
 - HTTP is a "stateless" protocol Whenever a user visits a web page, the user opens a separate connection with the webserver, 
   and the server does not keep a record of preceding client requests. 

 SessionBean :-
 - A bean which can be invoked by a client over local, remote or web service client views, programmatically and encapsulates 
   business logic is known as a session bean.  
     
  Types :- 
  1)Stateful :-
  - Values of the instance variables of an object are stored in its state.
    
  2)Stateless :-
  - A conversational state with the client is not maintained by a stateless session bean.

  3)Singleton :-
  - A bean which is instantiated once per application and exists throughout the lifecycle of the developed application  


2)Explain rols of model in mvc design pattern :-
 - Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern specifies that an application consist of a data model, presentation information, and 
   control information. 
 - The pattern requires that each of these be separated into different objects.
 
 Diagram :- https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/MVC-Design-Pattern.png

 - Model contains only the pure application data, it contains no logic describing how to present the data to a user.
 - It Also Manages Business logic with the database access
 - Controller send request to the model for processing user requests and response returns back to the controller


3)Explain Hibernate Configuration File and Properties File :- 
 - Hibernate Configuration File(cfg file) is the uses to establish connection to the database server.
 - It is an XML file which name is hibernate.cfg.xml.
 - There must be one configuration file for each database used in the application
 - We can acquire the Configuration class instance by instantiating it directly and specifying mappings in the configuration file. 
 - Use the addResource() method, if the mapping files are present in the classpath.
 Syntax :- Configuration cfg = new Configuration().addResource("employee.hbm.xml")  

 Files :-
 <?xml>  :- 
 - Defines the version and encoding type used for the XML document.
 
 <DOCTYPE> :- 
 - Specifies the Document Type Definition (DTD) for the XML  elements. 
 - DTD specifies the grammar rule for the XML document. For  example, DTD for hibernate.cfg.xml file is specified as  
   http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-configuration-3.0.dtd.

 <hibernate-configuration> :-  
 - Specifies all the configuration details  that the application uses to communicate with the underlying database.
 
 <session-factory> :- 
 - Contains the database and application specific  properties that a Session object uses to establish a communication link  
   between the application and the database.

 <property> :- 
 - Defines the various properties that are required to connect  with the database.
 
 <mapping> :- 
 - Specifies the name of the Hibernate mapping file that defines the mapping of a database table to a class.

 Example :-
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
 <!DOCTYPE hibernate-configuration SYSTEM "http://www.hibernate.org/dtd/hibernate-configuration-3.0.dtd">
 <hibernate-configuration>
    <session-factory>
        
        <property name="hibernate.dialect"> org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect </property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class"> com.mysql.jdbc.Driver </property>
        
        <!-- Assume test is the database name -->
        <property name="hibernate.connection.url"> jdbc:mysql://localhost/test </property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.username"> root </property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.password"> root123 </property>
        
        <!-- List of XML mapping files -->
        <mapping resource="Employee.hbm.xml"/>

    </session-factory>
</hibernate-configuration>
 

4)Explain Annotation? :-
 - Java annotation is a form of metadata that can be added to Java source code. 
 - Hibernate is the most popular implement of JPA specification annotation and provides some additional annotations.
 - JPA annotations are used in mapping java objects to the database tables, columns etc
 - All the metadata is clubbed into the POJO java file along with the code, this helps the user to understand the table structure 
   and POJO simultaneously during the development

  Hibernate Annotation :-
  @Entity :- 
  - Is used to specify a class as an entity bean. It is contained inside the javax.persistence package.

  @Table :- 
  - Used to specify the name of the table. 

  @Column :- 
  - used to specify the column name. 
  - It contains the following attributes:
     name     : Specifies the name of the column.
     length   : Specifies the length of the column.
     nullable : Specifies the column to be NOT NULL.
     unique   : Specifies the column to contain unique values.

  @Id :- 
  -Used to define the column as an identifier or a primary key.

  @GeneratedValue :- 
  - Specify the identifier generation  strategy. 
    Types :-
      AUTO
      IDENTITY
      SEQUENCE
      TABLE
  
  @OrderBy :- Sort your data using @OrderBy annotation
 
  @Transient :- Every non static and non-transient property of an entity is considered persistent, unless you annotate it as @Transient

  @Lob :- Large objects are declared with @Lob
 
  Annotations for Mapping between tables :-
  - @OneToOne 
  - @ManyToOne
  - @OneToMany
  - @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn
  - @JoinColumn

Q- 4 : A 1Marks
1)Hibernate.cfg.xml file is a ______ file :-
- Configuration File

2)Define MVC :-
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: 
  the model, the view, and the controller. 

3)What is ORM :-
- ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique for converting data between relational databases 
  and object oriented programming languages such as Java, C#, etc. 

4)What is EJB :-
- Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) is a specification for developing large-scale, distributed business applications on the Java platform.

Q- 4 : B 2Marks
1)What is EntityBean        :- 
 - Used to manage data which is persistent, to perform complex business logic and can be uniquely identified by making use of 
   primary key is known as an entity bean
 - An “entity bean” is a business encodes persistent object which forms and integral part of JAVA Enterprise edition. 
 - They can persistent independently or can delegate this to the container. 
 - A container is used to host the EJB Services and in case container or server crashes, then also beans survive the crash as 
   these are linked to primary keys present in the database.
  
  Types :- 
  1)Container Managed Persistence (CMP) 
  2)Bean-Managed Persistence (BMP). 


2)List-Out types of EJB     :- 
- Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) is a specification for developing large-scale, distributed business applications on the Java platform.

 Types Of EJB :- 
   1)SessionBean :-
   - A bean which can be invoked by a client over local, remote or web service client views, programmatically and encapsulates 
     business logic is known as a session bean.  
     
     Types :- 
     1)Stateful :-
     - Values of the instance variables of an object are stored in its state.
    
     2)Stateless :-
     - A conversational state with the client is not maintained by a stateless session bean.

     3)Singleton :-
     - A bean which is instantiated once per application and exists throughout the lifecycle of the developed application 

   2)EntityBean :-
   - Used to manage data which is persistent, to perform complex business logic and can be uniquely identified by making use of 
     primary key is known as an entity bean

   3)Message-Driven Bean :- 
   - allowed to process messages asynchronously by making use of message driven beans with the help of JMS(Java Message Service)

Q- 4 : C 3Marks
1)Explain Message driven beans    :-
 - A message-driven bean combines features of a session bean and a Java Message Service (JMS) message listener, allowing a business 
   component to receive JMS. 
 - message-driven bean enables asynchronous clients to access the business logic in the EJB tier. 

 Timer Service :-
 - Timer Service is a mechanism using which scheduled application can be build. 
 - EJB 3.0 specification has specified @Timeout annotation which helps in programming the ejb service in a stateless or message 
   driven bean. 
 - EJB Container calls the method which is annotated by @Timeout.
 - EJB Timer Service is a service provided by Ejb container which helps to create timer and to schedule callback when timer expires.
